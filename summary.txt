 The Raspberry Pi Pico is a low-cost microcontroller board with a RP2040 chip, featuring a dual-core Cortex M0+
processor, 264kB SRAM, and 2MB QSPI Flash. It has 30 GPIO pins, ADC inputs, digital peripherals, and 2 Programmable IO
(PIO) blocks. The board is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-ND) and is
compatible with Raspberry Pi Ltd's Standard Terms and Conditions.  The Raspberry Pi Pico Datasheet provides detailed
information about the board's pinout, components, and power supply. The board's Rev3 version features an on-board buck-
boost SMPS, allowing it to generate 3.3V for RP2040 and external circuitry from a wide range of input voltages. It can
be powered via micro-USB or an external power source (1.8-5.5V range).  The board's 2MB QSPI Flash memory can be
programmed or reprogrammed using the Serial Wire Debug (SWD) port or through the USB Mass Storage Device mode. The
RP2040 chip has 30 available GPIO pins, with 26 exposed via the Pico header pins. The power consumption, temperature
range, and VBUS are also specified.  The board's SMPS exhibits ripple at light load, affecting the ADC supply. To
improve efficiency during infrequent ADC measurements, the low-power Pulse Frequency Modulation (PFM) mode can be re-
enabled. An external 3.0V shunt reference or a separate power source can be used for better ADC accuracy.  The board
features a power supply system with a crude battery voltage monitor and a buck-boost SMPS for maintaining a 3.3V output
from 1.8V to 5.5V input. The RP2040 microcontroller has an on-chip regulator that powers its digital core at 1.1V. The
Pico can be used in USB Host mode, requiring 5V to be supplied to the VBUS pin.  The Raspberry Pi Pico will be available
until at least January 2028, and its datasheet and firmware/software are regularly updated. The "Getting started with
Raspberry Pi Pico" series of books offers guidance on loading programs onto the Raspberry Pi Pico board and installing
the C/C++ SDK. The Raspberry Pi Pico design files are openly available.
